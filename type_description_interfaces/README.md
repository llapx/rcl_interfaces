## TODO

* How to store default values, should store default values? Current storing as string, but will impact hashing.
* Do we (will we) support fixed sized strings vs. just having bounded strings?
* Should we pick limits (bounds) for strings in these types, e.g. type names, default values, etc?
* Should we pick limits (bounds) for sequences in these types, e.g. number of referenced types?
* How should we handle Services and Actions?
